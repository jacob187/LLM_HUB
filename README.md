# Large Language Model Hub

## Description

My goal for this project is to create a universal interface for interacting with LLMs by leveraging langchain. Ultimatley, I want to create a modular structure where I can build APIs to integrate LLMs into other applications.

## Current Structure

### Models

I have used inheritance to create a LLM model in `llm_app/backend/llms`. I'm using the `BaseLLM` to create new LLM classes as desired.
